An LLM-first security testing toolkit that enables coding agents to collaborate with you on security testing. Sectool exposes security testing tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol), letting you brainstorm with an agent, validate security reports together, or have the agent probe vulnerabilities in parallel with your own testing.

## Project Status

Early development, but usable! Current plans:

1. **Stabilize the MCP interface** — Active iteration based on agent feedback.
2. **Refactor once the agent interface is well-designed** — The current code design is an artifact of prototype iterations.
3. **Pre-compiled binaries after stabilization** — Until then, `make build` is required to use this project.

We will keep adding features (see [Issues](https://github.com/go-harden/llm-security-toolbox/issues) for planned work) with the goal of enabling a highly collaborative security agent experience.

Questions or recommendations? Please [open an Issue](https://github.com/go-harden/llm-security-toolbox/issues)!

## Getting Started

### 1. Install sectool

Download the binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/go-harden/llm-security-toolbox/releases), or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-harden/llm-security-toolbox.git
cd llm-security-toolbox
make build
```

### 2. Set up Burp Suite with MCP

Install [Burp Suite Community](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) and add the MCP extension from the BApp Store.

Start Burp and ensure the MCP server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:9876/sse`. It's best if your burp session starts fresh without a proxy history for when starting with your agent.

> Note: Burp MCP is currently required. A built-in proxy is planned for future releases ([#3](https://github.com/go-harden/llm-security-toolbox/issues/3)).

### 3. Start the MCP server

Run sectool as an MCP server:

```bash
sectool mcp
```

This starts an MCP server on port 9119 with two endpoints:
- `/mcp` - Streamable HTTP transport (recommended)
- `/sse` - SSE transport (legacy, for older clients)

**Workflow modes:** Use `--workflow` to configure how the agent receives testing instructions:

```bash
sectool mcp                        # Default: agent selects task type via workflow tool
sectool mcp --workflow explore     # Pre-set exploration mode (token-optimized)
sectool mcp --workflow test-report # Pre-set validation mode (token-optimized)
sectool mcp --workflow none        # No workflow instructions
```

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| (default) | Agent decides task type by calling `workflow` tool first, receives collaboration instructions, all tools available |
| `explore` | Exploratory security testing; token-optimized (no tool call needed), all tools available |
| `test-report` | Validating a specific vulnerability report; token-optimized, crawl tools excluded |
| `none` | No workflow instructions, all tools available immediately |

Agents generally want to do everything for you (sometimes poorly), or step you through a process without adding much value. Our workflow instructions guide a more collaborative approach that strikes a balance between these extremes, while focusing instruction tokens on specific task goals. If the default behavior doesn't work for you, try `--workflow none` and [open an issue](https://github.com/go-harden/llm-security-toolbox/issues) describing your experience or recommendations.

### 4. Configure your agent

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http sectool http://127.0.0.1:9119/mcp
```

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`):
```toml
[mcp_servers.sectool]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:9119/mcp"
```

### 5. Collaborate on testing

Work with the agent to build a test plan and execute it together. The agent can query proxy history, replay modified requests, and test for out-of-band interactions while you handle browser-based actions like authentication.

## CLI Usage

The CLI provides a human-friendly interface to the same MCP tools that agents use. CLI commands require the MCP server to be running (`sectool mcp`).

```bash
# Proxy history
sectool proxy summary              # Aggregated traffic summary
sectool proxy list --host example  # List flows matching filter
sectool proxy export <flow_id>     # Export flow to ./sectool-requests/<flow_id>/

# Crawling
sectool crawl create --url https://example.com
sectool crawl status <session_id>
sectool crawl list <session_id>

# Replay requests
sectool replay send --flow <flow_id> --add-header "X-Test: value"
sectool replay get <replay_id>

# Out-of-band testing
sectool oast create
sectool oast poll <oast_id>

# Encoding utilities
sectool encode url "hello world"
sectool encode base64 "test"
```

Use `sectool <command> --help` for detailed options.

## Key Features

- **Proxy history access** - Query and filter HTTP traffic captured through Burp Suite
- **Proxy rules** - Add match/replace rules to modify requests and responses in transit
- **Request export and replay** - Export requests to disk, edit them, and replay with modifications
- **Web crawling** - Discover application structure, forms, and endpoints
- **OAST testing** - Create out-of-band domains and poll for DNS/HTTP/SMTP interactions via Interactsh
- **Encoding utilities** - URL, Base64, and HTML entity encoding/decoding
- **LLM-optimized** - Interactions optimized for agent usage
